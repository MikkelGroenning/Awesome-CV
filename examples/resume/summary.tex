Senior Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience architecting and scaling enterprise data platforms across retail, pharma, and ESG. Proven success in translating complex business requirements into compliant, scalable, and AI-ready architectures with strong focus on data governance and GDPR compliance that deliver measurable business value.

Currently driving the enterprise data platform build at JOE \& THE JUICE, creating a foundation for IPO-grade financial reporting, comprehensive data governance frameworks, and self-service analytics. Expert in data modeling (Kimball, medallion, semantic layers), cloud-native platforms (AWS \& Azure), role-based access control systems, and DataOps practices that enable automation, integration, and advanced AI/ML.

Ready to step into senior leadership roles to expand my impact in larger, more complex organizations, where I can mentor and grow teams, contribute to practice development, and deliver high-value digital transformations. This represents the next leap in my career: combining technical depth with strategic leadership.
